Heap (priorityQueue)

Maintain a min-heap with size 10. Add numbers to the queue and keeping track of the smallest number in the queue, then iterating through the other numbers,
and each time we find one that is larger than the largest number in the priority queue, we remove the smallest number, add the new number,
and again keep track of the smallest number in the queue.
